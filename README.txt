This recipe allows you to setup a Django_ project through `zc.buildout`_.

Usage
*****

The main scope of the recipe is to abstract out the ``settings.py`` file,
allowing settings to reside inside the buildout instead of having them reside
into code (leading to an awkard handling of the same in respect to versioning,
for example). The ``settings.py`` file is generated by a template, either the
default one, the default one and a user extension, or a totally new one.

The template uses the Tempita_ templating system.

The most basic usage of this recipe is as follows: ::

    [buildout]
    parts = django

    [django]
    recipe = djc.recipe
    project = my.project

Where ``my.project`` is an importable package containing a ``urls`` module and
a ``templates`` directory.

As you see, very few options are specified here: the defaults are used to build
up the ``settings.py`` file.

Of course, real examples tend to be slightly more complex: see Options_,
`Default template options`_ and `Example usage`_ for more details.
